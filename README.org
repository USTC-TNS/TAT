The [[https://github.com/USTC-TNS/TNSP][TNSP(tensor network state packages) framework]] streamlines the development of tensor network state methods. It comprises various packages:
- [[./TAT/][=TAT=]] :: the core tensor package to provide a unified interface for various types of tensor such as Abelian [[https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.82.050301][symmetry tensors]] and [[https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.99.195153][fermion tensors]], written in C++, and providing a [[./PyTAT/][Python interface]].
- [[./tetragono/][=tetragono=]] :: a tensor network state package offering a user-friendly unified interface for various TNS methods across different physics models and tensor types.
- [[./tetraku/][=tetraku=]] :: a collection including physical models and algorithm customization for tetragono.
- [[./lazy_graph/][=lazy_graph=]] :: an auxiliary package to facilitate lazy evaluation mechanisms in tetragono.
- [[./PyScalapack/][=PyScalapack=]] :: an auxiliary package to offer a Python interface for ScaLAPACK within tetragono.
- [[./tnsp_bridge/][=tnsp_bridge=]] :: an auxiliary package to enable format conversion with [[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2018.03.006][older TNSP versions]].
