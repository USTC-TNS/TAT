* tnsp-bridge

tnsp-bridge is a small tool to convert tensor data from [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001046551830078X][tnsp]] format to TAT format.

The formats of TNSP between versions often vary, and this subprocject only works for TNSP 4.0.2.
Since this subprocject is used in rare case, it will not be documented currently.
