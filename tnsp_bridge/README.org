TNSP-Bridge is a tool designed to facilitate the conversion of tensor data from [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001046551830078X][TNSP]] format to [[https://github.com/USTC-TNS/TNSP/tree/main/PyTAT][TAT]] format.
It's important to note that different versions of TNSP may have variations in their data structures,
but this specific subproject focuses on compatibility with TNSP version 4.
However, due to its infrequent usage, there is currently no official documentation available for this subproject.
